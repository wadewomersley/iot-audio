I was going to develop this more before releasing it but it's so simple right now I've decided to release it now and build up as it works perfectly on a Pi 2 with Windows IOT and integrates perfectly with a Google Home device using IFTTT.

# Getting Started

  - Build to your IOT Pi using Visual Studio
  - Connect on port 16000.


You can also:
  - Publish port 16000 publically and use the API remotely to send commands to update music.
